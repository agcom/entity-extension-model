# Entity

For the best clarification, open a **dictionary** and checkout the word 'entity'.

- [Wiktionary | entity](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/entity)
- [Lexico | entity](https://www.lexico.com/definition/entity)

A thing apart from its variant properties, is an entity.

For example, person is an entity, and 'name' is a variant property of the person entity.

Each specific person is called an instance.

## Instance

A specific example of an entity is called an instance of that entity. More formally, a thing with its variant properties is an instance of its entity.

For example, me, Alireza Ghasemi is an instance of the person entity.

As expected, an entity can have multiple instances.

> If you're familiar with [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), entity is similar to class and instance is similar to object.
