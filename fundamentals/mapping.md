# Mapping

In mathematics, 'mapping' is an operation that associates each element of a given set (domain) with some elements of a second set (range).

It's the same in here. A mapping **associates** each instance of the **admitted entity** with a set of instances of an(other) entity.

- Domain: Instances of the admitted entity.
- Range: Instances of an(other) entity.

For example, every person have a name. We can define a mapping which associates each instance of the person entity with a singular set which references an instance of the string entity (or the name entity if available).

Or, every person may have some children. We can define a mapping which associates each instance of the person entity with a set of instances of the person entity.
