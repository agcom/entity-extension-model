# Mapping

In mathematics, 'mapping' is an operation that associates each element of a given set (domain) with some elements of a second set (range).

It's the same in here. A mapping **associates** each instance of the **admitted type** with a set of instances of a type.

- Domain: Instances of the admitted type.
- Range: Instances of a type.

For example, every person have a name. We can define a mapping which associates each instance of the person type with a singular set which references an instance of the string type (or the name type if available).

Or, every person may have some children. We can define a mapping which associates each instance of the person type with a set of instances of the person type.
