# Type

For the best clarification, open a **dictionary** and checkout the word 'type'.

- [Wiktionary \| type](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/type)
- [Lexico \| type](https://www.lexico.com/definition/type)

A thing apart from its variant properties, is a type. A type admits to a set of mappings (potentially an empty set).

> What's a mapping? We'll talk about it later.

For example, person is a type, and 'name' is a variant property of the person type.

Each specific person is called an instance.

## Instance

A specific example of a type is called an instance of that type. More formally, a thing with its variant properties is an instance of its type.

For example, Alireza Ghasemi is an instance of the person type.

As expected, a type can have multiple instances.

> If you're familiar with [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), type is similar to class and instance is similar to object.
