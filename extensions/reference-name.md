# Reference name

It's suggested to assign a string as a name to each entity and each mapping. Thus, you can reference them by their names.

A reference name,

- Should be **unique** in the whole context it's used in.
- Can be anything!

	> You may use conventions. For example, you can use Java qualified class names' convention.

Examples,

- *Person* entity
- *String* entity
- *Name* mapping
- *Children* mapping
