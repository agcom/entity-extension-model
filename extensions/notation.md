# Notation

A **suggested** notation for EM model.

It's all just about defining entities and mappings.

> A `<...>` block indicates a replacement/input, and the note inside, describes the replacement type.
>
> A set replacement should be done by separating set members using commas. For example,
>
> - `<set of entities>`, replaced by `Name, Mother, Father, Children`.

### Entity

`<entity> : <set of mappings>`

- `<entity>`: Entity reference.

- `<set of mappings>`: Admitted mappings.

### Mapping

`<mapping> -> <entity>`

- `<mapping>`: Mapping reference.

- `<entity>`: Associated entity.
