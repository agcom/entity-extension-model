# Notation

A **suggested** notation for EM.

It's all just about defining entities and mappings.

> A `<...>` block indicates a replacement/input, and the note inside, describes the replacement type.
>
> A set replacement should be done by writing set members separated using commas. For example,
>
> - `<set of mappings>`, replaced by `name, mother, father, children`.

### Entity

`<entity> : <set of mappings>`

- `<entity>`: Entity reference/identifier.

- `<set of mappings>`: Admitted mappings.

> In case of an empty set of mappings, both following notations are considered correct.
>
> - `<entity>`
> - `<entity> :`

### Mapping

`<mapping> -> <entity>`

- `<mapping>`: Mapping reference/identifier.

- `<entity>`: Associated entity.
